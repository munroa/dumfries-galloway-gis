Dumfries & Galloway Emergency GIS Documentation
----------

Our project was initially to build a system that allowed for open access to high-level geographical data on Dumfries and Galloway, usually only accessible through a Geographical Information System (or GIS). Our brief was to give the general public access to this data in a highly accessible way where no specialist software or tools were needed. As the project developed however, the scope changed significantly. Halfway through the project lifecycle we were asked to change the specification of the system to a professional service providing emergency services data from all areas of local government in a single, integrated system
